# tlearn

*tlearn* is an interactive Linux tool to learn command-line skills. It
consists of a front-end Bash script called `tlearn` and a set of
*lesson* scripts, one for each lesson.

There is a file called `functions` which holds a number of simple Bash
functions that can be called to make writing lessons a bit easier. The
functions mainly help control the sessions, panes and windows of `tmux`.

For now, this is all in an early stage of development. I'd recommend
that you read through the `functions` file, and also the 
`command_line_basics_part1.tl` lesson file.
